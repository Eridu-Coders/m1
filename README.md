# Introduction

This project, which is still unnamed, aims to create a software suite to help the scholar write _Bhashyas_ (commentaries) on ancient texts. Specifically, the goal is to preserve the links inherent in the quotations within each _Bhashyas_ while retaining the ease of use of WYSIWIG tools like Microsoft Word and other wordprocessors.
