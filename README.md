# Introduction

This project, which is still unnamed, aims to create a software suite to help the Vaishnava scholar write _Bhashyas_ (commentaries) on ancient texts. Specifically, the goal is to preserve the links inherent in the quotations within each _Bhashya_ while retaining the ease of use of WYSIWIG tools like Microsoft Word and other wordprocessors.

At its core is a graph database (NOSQL) which is a natural fit for the graph of quotations inherent in all _Bhashyas_ taken as a whole. The interface gives access to the texts both in a graph-structured way (left-hand panel on the screenshot below) and in a WYSIWIG fashion (right-hand panel).

# Naming

For the moment, the software goes under the temporary moniker "m1". In due course, a suitable name should be chosen.
